                Dear Love! Happy Aniversary!! woohooo we reach 1 year na baba. I'm so happy! We've been through a lot the whole year and let's face them this year also. A lot happened to us, misunderstandings, tampuhan, kulitan, kasiyahan, all of that to have our relationship happy and healthy. The first year is just preparation to what's coming for the next years love we can do this! I'm sorry if sometimes I'm not in the mood po or you think I don't love you. I'm sorry if I make you upset po, I'm sorry for not attentive sometimes to you. I'm sorry for everything love. I will make it up to you always! Through out the year baba I was struck by your beauty and charm, my eyes we're hearts, my heart beat singing like an opera. When I first saw you it feels magical, fantasy, you're beautiful and gorgeous. I know nasabi ko na ito sayo before po pero sobrang ganda mo talaga baba ko!! A lot happened to us this year but we manage to conquer all challenges that strike us.
